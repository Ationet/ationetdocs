## Declined Transactions
ATIONet separates unauthorized transactions into 2 sections: [Exceptions](#exceptions) and **Declined Transactions**.

Declined Transactions are those that managed to pass ATIONet's hard authentications, but were rejected by other validations such as an unsatisfied rule or balance validation.
In the Volume Dispensed, Unit Price Dispensed, Amount Dispensed, Contract Unit Price, Contract Amount columns, you can see with which currency the rejected transaction was made.

![Declined Transactions](https://github.com/nuchavez/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Declined%20Transactions.PNG)

In this view, at the start you can filter by the type of rejection. The types of rejections available are as follows:

![Declined Transactions Filters](https://github.com/nuchavez/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Declined%20Transactions%20Filters.PNG)

## Dispensed Transactions
In this section you can view all transactions that had fuel dispensed. With the incorporation of the Multicurrency functionality, in the Amount Dispensed column it will be possible to view the currency with which each transaction was made.

![Dispensed Transactions](https://github.com/nuchavez/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Dispensed%20Transactions.PNG)

## Disputed Transactions
Disputed transactions are those that either party (Merchant or Company) claims to be unaware of.

In this section you can consult the disputed transactions, listed by code, date, reason, state, transaction number, company, site. There is also the commentary of the company, the merchant and the network.

![Disputed Transactions](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Disputed%20Transactions.PNG)

## Exceptions
ATIONet separates unauthorized transactions into 2 sections: **Exceptions** and [Declined transactions](#declined-transactions). Exceptions are those transactions that did not pass the hard validations of the system or those that are detected as possible frauds.

![Exceptions](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Exceptions.PNG)

In this view, at the start you can filter by the type of exception. The types of exceptions available are as follows:

![Exceptions Filters](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Exceptions%20Filters.PNG)

Some transactions remain in **Review** status in some situations, such as when more than authorized is sent (due to a controller or POS error). In these cases it is necessary to approve or reject the transaction using one of the two icons to the right of each record.

## Fast Track Configuration
A Fast Track in ATIONet is a way to configure a one-use-only authorization for an specific amount to an already existing fleet sub-account. In this sections you can configure up to 10 Custom Fields for Fast Tracks.

![Fast Track Configuration](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Fast%20Track%20Configuration.PNG)

When you have finished filling in the fields, click the **Save** button.

## Identifications Scheduler


## Invoice Type

## Merchants Contracts
In ATIONet the term merchant refers to the entity that owns the sites. In this section you can consult, edit and create merchant contracts. To make queries easier, there is a panel of filters at the top.

![Merchant Contracts](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Merchant%20Contracts.PNG)

To create a merchant contract, click the **New** button.

![Merchant Contract New](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Merchant%20Contracts%20New.PNG)

The fields to be completed are as follows:

* **Code:** Input the code of the contract.
* **Automatically Generated:** Checkmark this option to have ATIONet automatically generate the contract code.
* **Description:** Input the description of the contract.
* **Merchant:** Select the merchant assocciated to the contract.

When you have finished filling in the fields, click the **Save** button.

## Merchant Current Accounts
The merchant current accounts view is where the balances and movements of all merchant are consulted.

For easier quieries there is a filter panel available and the first option in the panel is the type of report to see (Contracts List, Contracts Movements, Sites List and Sites Movements).

![Merchant Current Accounts](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Merchant%20Current%20Accounts.PNG)

## Outstanding Authorizations
In ATIONet outstanding authorizations are those transactions that have not yet received the completion transaction, but have been pre-authorized. The information seen in this view are dispatches that are currently underway. If for some reason there are old pre-authorizations, it is likely that the POS did not send the completion transaction or the cancellation transaction if the dispatch was not completed.

Please note that at the time of pre-authorization, ATIONet froze the amount of the authorization of the current account for the sub-account associated. This view presents all the fields necessary to identify the transaction and the sub-account. If you need to see more details, clicking on the authorization code will take you to the transaction details view.

![Outstanding Authorization](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Outstanding%20Authorization.PNG)

If old pending transactions appear and you are sure it is not an ongoing dispatch, you may cancel them and return the balance to the current account.
To do so there are 2 ways: individually, by clicking on the **X** icon to the right side of the grid, or massively by selecting the transactions, displaying the **Batch Actions** menu and selecting **Cancel**. This will cancel the transactions and return the balance reserved to each of the current accounts. (for more details on the transaction flow refer to this [document](AN-Transaction_Flows-TechGuide.md))

## Over Limit
In this section you can consult or create over limits for company contracts. Over limit in ATIONet refers to an amount that sub-accounts can overextend from their balances.

![Over Limit](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Over%20Limit.PNG)

To create an over limit, click the **New** button.

![Over Limit New](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Over%20Limit%20New.PNG)

Inside this section you can consult, edit or create fleet programs. For every Network, ATIONet already has a CLASSIC program created by default. A fleet progam in ATIONet allows identifications to override some of their behaviors, like for example: Balance Mode, Contingency Support, Offline Support, etc.

## Rules
In ATIONet rules refer to limits that can be configured by the company and associated to different entities. Inside this view you can consult, create or edit rules. There are different type of rules: Quota, Date Range, Location, Fuel, Limit Per Transactions, DaysTime, Prompting, Dry Transaction Limit and Dry Quota Limit.

Take into consideration that all rules can be **Non Blocking**, which it means that ATIONet will not reject the transaction even when the parameters are met.

![Rules](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/Fleets/Rules.PNG)

1. **Quota:** In this rule you can limit transactions quantity, volume and/or money on an specific frequency.

## Transactions ERP

## Uncontrolled Transactions
Uncontrolled transactions are those that are generated because the controller detects a difference in gauges and sends a transaction for the difference. These transactions do not contain data about the identification, since they were generated automatically and were not initiated with the presentation of an identification. As they do not have an identification assigned, they are not impacted in any current account nor do they count for the calculation of rules.
