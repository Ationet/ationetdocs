##  Outstanding Authorizations

In ATIONet, pending authorizations are transactions that have not yet received the completion transaction but have been preauthorized. The information shown in this view is for shipments that are currently in progress. If for some reason there are old preauthorization, it is likely that the POS terminal has not sent the completion transaction or the cancellation transaction if the shipment has not been completed.
Please note that at the time of preauthorization, ATIONet froze the authorization amount from the checking account for the associated subaccount. This view displays all the fields necessary to identify the transaction and the subaccount. If you need to see more details, clicking on the authorization code will take you to the transaction details view.

If old pending transactions appear and you are sure that they are not a shipment in progress, you can cancel them and return the balance to the checking account. There are two ways to do this: individually, by clicking on the X icon on the right, or in bulk, by selecting the transactions, opening the Batch Actions menu, and selecting Cancel. This will cancel the transactions and return the reserved balance to each of the current accounts. (For more details on the transaction flow, see this document).
