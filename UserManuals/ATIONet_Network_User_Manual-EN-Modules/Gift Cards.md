# Cards

In this section, you can view the cards that have been created, as well as enable/disable cards and, if necessary, mark them as lost.

![Cards (Menu)](https://github.com/Ationet/ationetdocs/blob/master/Content/Images/User%20Manual%20ATIONet/GiftCards/Cards%20(Menu).PNG)

In turn, in the "Batch Actions" option, you can activate or deactivate multiple cards simply by selecting the cards using the box on the left. Finally, the "Update" button allows you to download a template from which you can perform a mass update of cards, which, unlike "Batch Actions," is not limited by Ationet's limit of 50 results.
